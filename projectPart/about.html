          <h2>What Exactly is a Spa?</h2>
          <p>
            A spa is a place where mineral-rich water or seawater is used for
            therapeutic bathing. Spa resorts and hot springs often offer
            treatments known as <em>balneotherapy</em>. People have trusted the
            healing benefits of mineral waters since ancient times. Such
            traditions are common worldwide, especially in Europe and Japan. In
            modern times, <strong>day spas</strong> are very popular and provide
            a wide range of personal care services.

          <h3>The Origins</h3>
          <p>
            The word <em>spa</em> comes from the Belgian town of Spa, famous
            since Roman times for its healing springs. The name was associated
            with the idea of fountains and natural springs. Some say it comes
            from the Latin word <em>spargere</em>, meaning “to sprinkle” or
            “moisten.”

          <h3>Treatments</h3>

            Spa treatments are non-medical services that aim to improve the
            health and relaxation of the body. These may include massages,
            facials, and body wraps. Treatments are usually found at resorts,
            wellness spas, or even beauty schools.

      <h2>What you need to know about spa!</h2>
      <p>
        A spa is a location where mineral-rich spring water (and sometimes seawater) is used to give
        medicinal baths. Spa towns or spa resorts typically offer various health treatments, which are
        also known as balneotherapy. The belief in the curative powers of mineral waters goes back to
        prehistoric times. Such practices have been popular worldwide, but are especially widespread in
        Europe and Japan. Day spas are also quite popular, and offer various personal care treatments.

      <h3 id="origins">Origins of the term</h3>
      <p>
        The term is derived from the town of Spa, Belgium, known back from Roman times when the location
        was called Aquae Spadanae. The word spa denotes "fountain". Some experts also suggest that the word
        originated from the Belgian town named Spa where a curative spring was discovered in the 14th century.
